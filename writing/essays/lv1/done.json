        "content": "The country that I would like to visit is Switzerland. here are some of my reasons for wanting to do so.\n\nI marvel at the sheer beauty of the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland that I see in postcards and magazines. Even though they are merely pictures, the beauty is conveyed. How wonderful it would be if I could be there in person, seeing the mountains with my own eyes, and experiencing what it is like to be in such a wonderful place.\n\nIt was my uncle who actually stirred my interest about Switzerland. he goes there from time to time as part of his work. He told me about skiing on the mountain slopes and how exhilarating the experience is. You ride the ski chairlift from the bottom of the mountain to the top. At the top you look down at the bottom several hundred meters below, put on your skiing gear and off you go down the slope reaching up to 100 km per hour at certain stretches. With wind brushing against your face and snow spraying outwards from both your skis, the feeling is quite intoxicating. Certainly there is a danger of losing your balance and breaking a limb or two, but with proper training the danger is minimal. My uncle has fallen several times but never had any limb broken.\n\nI read up everything I could find about Switzerland, in books, magazines, brochures and the Internet. I found out that beautiful mountains and skiing are not the only things Switzerland has. It also has beautiful lakes, vineyards and centuries-old buildings that are untouched by the ravages of war. Switzerland has always been neutral and thus has been spared the horror that wasted most of Europe during the two World Wars.\n\nOther things that the Swiss are famous for are their high quality watches and their punctuality. I suppose these two go hand-in-hand. My uncle says their trains and buses are punctual to within a minute. Stand at the correct train platform at the right time and you can be sure that the train will arrive on time. This is something I have to experience for myself.\n\nIn time when I have the means, I will surely visit Switzerland and find out for myself all the wonders that the country has to offer."

        "content": "ree time is when all my homework and chores have been done for the day and I am \"free\" to do things that I enjoy doing.\n\nUsually I spend time watching television. As my favorite TV shows come on at specific times, I make sure that I finish my homework and chores well before the shows. Otherwise I will have to miss them. Mostly I manage to watch the shows but sometimes extra homework or chores may cause me to miss a show or two, but it is rare. Anyhow if I know that I am definitely not able to catch a show in time, I will just set the video recorder to tape the show so that I can watch it later.\n\nAnother thing that I do in my free time is potter around in the garden with my mother. She plants a fair bit of flowers and I enjoy helping her take care of them. It is a pleasure to feel the soil, prune the plants, remove the weeds and do the little things that help the plants grow better. It always fills me with wonder to watch seedlings germinate, sprout leaves and eventually grow to produce beautiful flowers.\n\nPottering around in the garden also taught me many things about the insects, butterflies, snails, caterpillars, centipedes, millipedes and other small creatures that inhabit the place. These creatures are mainly harmless and watching them go about their 'chores' always fascinates me.\n\nIn the evening when the weather is fine, i sometimes go for a stroll around the neighborhood with my friends. This is the time when most the neighbors have come home from work or school. We say hello to those whom we know. They are mostly friendly people and they acknowledge our greetings. Once in a while we come upon unfriendly neighbors but we just ignore them and carry on.\n\nIn the night, I usually do a bit of reading before going to bed. Books are like little treasure chests. A lot of information and knowledge are to be found in them and all it takes is a bit of time spent reading them. This is certainly a very beneficial way to spend my free time. After a spot of reading, it is time for bed and on to another day."

        "content": "In our modern cities, we find hundreds of shopping complexes, centers, malls, arcades, supermarkets, mini markets -- all catering for the apparently endless streams of people whose only pleasure in life seems to be shopping.\nWhile I do not deny that shopping has its pleasures, I must add that shopping also has its displeasures, perhaps even more than the pleasures.\n\nAn example of the pleasure of shopping is to find a perfectly fitting pair of jeans for half the usual price, only after spending one hour of displeasure going through a huge pile of garments dumped at the discount section of the shopping center. What more, there are a dozen other people rummaging through the garments as well. Worst still is that you have to buy two garments in order to qualify for the half price. In effect you end up buying something you are not particularly interested in.\n\nThe interior of shopping centers are usually attractively decorated and the air is cool. However as modern shopping centers are so huge, it would be an impossible task to visit even a fraction of them in one day. Furthermore, parking costs escalates the more time you spend in a shopping center. Time is money -- money flowing out your pocket the longer you leave your car in the car park.\n\nA great displeasure occurs when you want to get something but do not know where to get it. So you consult the map that they display in the premises. It takes time to go through the map and finally when you find the shop you want, you discover it is four floors from where you are. So you trudge along up the escalators until you reach the shop only to find that what they have is not exactly what you want.\n\nThe most displeasurable part of shopping is checking out. Often there are long queues of people all wanting to do the same thing. So you select what seems to be the fastest line only to find some idiot ahead is having problems with the cashier.\n\nFinally when all the shopping is done and you have got very good deals for the things you have purchased, you lug your heavy bags to the car and go home. That is not the end of the story though. On reaching home, another story begins. You will have to unpack the stuff you just bought. That is another displeasure and another story."

        "content": "My granduncle is the grouchiest person I have ever met. I have never seen him in a happy mood or heard him speak in a gentle voice. It is always a scowling face and a harsh grating voice. I usually keep my distance with him and avoid contact as much as possible, although sometimes it is not possible.\nHe is my grandmother's younger brother on my mother's side. My mother used to tell me that he has had a hard life. He became the breadwinner of the family when he was in his teens after his father died. He worked all his life in the construction business as a bricklayer and mason. It was probably through his hard toils and labor that he developed his very grouchy personality. He is in his sixties now but still goes out to work wherever he finds it.\n\nHe is not tall but his limbs are exceptionally long and his hands and feet are exceptionally large. I suppose it is this combination that gives him exceptional strength for I have seen him carry two bags of cement, one in each hand, with apparent ease. A normal man would be struggling with just one bag. Often his workers would reap his wrath when they are unable to keep up with his work, or his strength. Four-letter words and the worst profanities under the sun would come out in torrents. The workers just keep quiet for none of them would dare to stand up to him.\n\nHow his wife and children tolerate him is a mystery to me. He and his wife lives together in the same house with his son and family. There are altogether six people in their three-room house that is just opposite mine. Frequently his harsh voice would come across as he chastises a family member, or the family dog. No one argues back. They know it is futile.\n\nMost mornings I see this grouchy man get into his beat-up old car on his way to work just as I go to school. Wishing him good morning is a waste of breath for he never answers. So I have given that up. It is better to leave him alone to scowl as much as he wants. Perhaps one day he will stop his grouchy ways, who knows."

        "content": "I was at my friend Rick's house to do some mathematics homework together. Rick's is a whiz with mathematics and he helped me complete the homework in record time.\n\nAs it was getting towards dinner time, I decided to head on home about two kilometers away. Outside the house I could see thick black clouds and flashes of lightning in the eastern sky. There was huge storm going on there. So I got on my bicycle to get home before the storm struck us.\n\nRick's mother came out, saw the distant storm and told me not to cycle home. She said that she would send me home in her car. It was better not take the risk of riding the bicycle on the busy main road in the middle of a storm. It was dangerous. I declined her offer, thanked her and pedalled off before she could say any more.\n\nJust as I got on the main road, the storm struck. Raindrops came thick and fast. In seconds I was soaked to the skin. I looked for shelter but could see none. Fortunately my books were in a plastic bag and they should be fine. So I decided that since I was already soaking wet, I might as well go all the way home on my bicycle.\n\nThe road was fairly quiet as it was out of town. Some cars and lorries passed me kicking up spray. I could not get any wetter so I did not mind. I had only one thing on my mind and that was to get home.\n\nIt was foolish of me to do cycle under such dangerous conditions as visibility was very low. One moment I was going along quiet nicely, the next I found myself lying in a puddle of water beside the road. The road was covered with water and I did not even realized that I have left it and had fallen into a hole. Fortunately the hole was not very big but it was very wet. I picked myself and the bicycle up and groped in the pool for my books. No plastic bag would have saved the books. They were wet through and through. I should have listened to Rick's mother's advice. now I still have more than a kilometer to go in the rain. As it was dangerous to cycle, I pushed my bicycle all the way home."

So I figured that I would not have to wait long for my turn.\n\nSuddenly I heard someone shout behind me. instinctively I looked around and was shocked to see two gunmen brandishing handguns and telling everyone in the bank to get down on the floor. I obeyed quickly. I was too stunned to feel any fear. I just lay down on the floor like the other customers.\n\nI could not see anything except the floor tiles next to my face but I heard harsh voices shouting, the sound of someone being hit and some death threats being uttered. It sounded like the robbers would not hesitate to shoot anyone who did not comply.\n\nFrom the corner of my eye I caught the sight of a pair of moving boots. For the first time I felt fear. The boots must be that of one of the robbers ! Anyhow the boots disappeared from view for a moment, reappeared and then disappeared again. I heard the trampling of feet and I knew that the robbers were making their escape. It did not take them long to do their dirty business.\n\nI raised my head and had a momentary glimpse of two figures running out of the bank door. Another figure flashed past my view and I realized that it was a security guard. He was holding a pump gun in his hands ! I got up to have a better view.\n\nThe security guard ran out of the bank just as the robbers were making their getaway on a motorcycle. The motorcycle sped off just as the guard leveled his gun and fired at the fleeing duo.\n\nEven in the bank, the sound of the shot was deafening. From my position I saw the shot hit the pillion rider smack on his back. There was a spray of blood and the body went limp. As the motorcycle accelerated, the pillion rider was flung backwards onto the road in a lifeless heap.\n\nThe guard fired another shot at the remaining motorcyclist. The shot missed the target but shattered the back screen of a car nearby.\n\nBy then I was out of the bank watching the real-life action. So were other customers. It was just like in the movies except that it was for real. The guard ran up to the robber that he had shot and examined the slumped figure. There was no sign of life. The guard then picked up a bag that the robber had dropped. No doubt it contained the loot.\n\nI watched the scene until the police arrive about ten minutes later. After I went home as there was no point hanging around I could do my banking at another time."

He had bought 3,000 shares. Multiply that by $0.46 would net him a profit of $1,380. Wow again ! He had made that amount in just one day.\nThe share market had been bullish for several weeks now and many people like Paul was getting a piece of the action. Rumors were rife that shares would keep rising indefinitely. It was the chance of a lifetime to make some serious money. In order to buy more shares, Paul took out a loan of $200,000 from a bank using his retail business as collateral.\n\nFor the whole of the following week, Paul joined hundreds of speculators in the stock exchange, buying up shares that kept rising. Paul's wife warned him about the consequences of a fall in the share prices, but Paul was confident that he could make his bundle and get out before the prices dropped.\n\nPrices kept rising. Paul estimated his profits to be in the region of $300,000 already. if the trend continued, he would have half a million in two weeks and a million in a month. He was confident that he would be a millionaire in a month's time.\n\nTwo weeks later, indeed Paul's total shares were worth more than half a million dollars, and the share prices were still rising. His wife advised him to sell and take the profit, but he refused. Just two more weeks and he would be a millionaire, two more weeks !\n\nThe drop cam every suddenly one day. At first Paul thought it was just a temporary fluctuation in the share prices. He held firm, confident that the prices will rebound upwards. it did the following day and Paul regained confidence. Then the prices fell again, and again. In three days, he had lost all his profits plus part of his capital. If he sold then, he would have made a dreadful loss. No, he would hold on. the prices would rise again.\n\nOne month later, Paul had lost almost everything. Share prices had reached an all-time low. There was despair all round.\n\nIn his greed for riches, Paul lost all his savings and now owed the bank to the tune of $200,000. Fortunately he had his retail business to fall back on. He would have to work extra hard to pay off the bank.\n\nSome speculators were not so lucky. They were reduced to bankruptcy. Such is the price of greed."

        "content": "In the light of the explosion of human population on earth, population control is definitely necessary. From one and three quarters billion in 1900, the population of the earth has multiplied to more than six billion in 2000, and no end to this growth seems to be in sight.\n\nGo to any town or city today and there are the ubiquitous traffic jams, long queues and crowded shopping areas. In such a crowded environment, it is not surprising to hear of accidents, clashes and friction between people.\n\nOn the employment scene, jobs are harder and harder to come by. In the times of my grandfather, a person with a primary education can easily find work and earn a decent living. secondary and education is rare and anyone who can make it that far is looked up on as a great person. Today there are many unemployed university graduates. A person with just a primary education is practically unemployable, except for the most menial of tasks. The sheer number of people vying for limited jobs has created this difficult situation.\n\nMore people mean more need of everything -- more jobs, more houses, more cars, more road and more problems to be solved. The strain on the earth's resources is unprecedented. Land is cleared to build more houses for the masses. Jungles and forests disappear as human beings encroach into them. There is less and less space for natural fauna and flora. Many of them are driven into extinction.\n\nThe disappearance of our jungles, forests and other natural habitats causes a change in the global climatic conditions. Already there are signs of global warming and other drastic changes to he earth. natural disasters strike without warning as these changes occur.\n\nLiving on earth is now a struggle for all but the very rich. Everyone has to work just to get by, if they can find work at all. Those who cannot find decent work resort to other means, usually illegal. Crime, organized or otherwise, is a problem in all nations.\n\nThere is a dire need for the world's population to be controlled, or at least, maintained at a sustainable level. As it is, the population keeps increasing and no effective effort is done to control it. If this continues, the day will come when the old earth can no longer sustain the human population. This means that many or most will die, probably because of nuclear wars that would have broken out in our struggle to survive. Or perhaps, human begins would have learnt to control their population some future time and thus avert the possible annihilation of the human race. It is entirely up to us to determine our destiny."

        "content": "Computers play a huge role in the modern world. We can get an idea of how huge a role this is if we examine some of the things in the modern world that we rely on and mostly take for granted.\nTelecommunication, transport, banking and finance -- the most important features of the modern world -- are heavily dependent on computers in order to function. A computer failure in any of these areas can incapacitate it, and perhaps the other areas too. The consequences can be anything from inconvenience to disaster. You may have experience the inconvenience of being unable to withdraw money from a bank because its computer is 'down'. So you wait until they fix the computer and you can withdraw money again. What happens if the down time should last several days ? The inconvenience could turn to indignation for you and disaster some businesses.\n\nCan you imagine what can happen if crucial computers fail in the transport systems, for example, the airlines ? Flight schedules can be severely interrupted, passengers can miss flights or board the wrong ones, or worst of all, accidents can happen. Air-traffic controllers rely on computers to direct aircraft landing and taking off. In a busy airport, aircrafts take off and land within seconds of each other. This is clearly impossible without computers.\n\nAnother area in which computers are very important is telecommunication. Today we communicate with one another via the telephone, fax machine and the Internet. The ease and speed of communication is unprecedented in the history of mankind. All we need is to press some buttons or log on to the Internet and we get to communicate instantly with each other. Physical distance matters little. Satellites, fiber optics and other devices make sure that we can communicate from the comfort of our homes, anywhere in the world as long we have the equipment to do it.\n\nCertainly this is all fantastic, but what can happen if the computers stop working, even if it were to be for a short while. Have you ever felt the exasperation of being unable to ring your friend or retrieve an email ? We are literally plunged straight back to the days of our forefathers when messages took days and weeks to reach their destination.\n\nComputers are here to stay and their importance is undeniable. In fact, they are indispensable. More and more they become part of our lives. Without computers, living will be like a hundred years ago -- no email, no ATM machines, no credit cards, no Internet and no video games. For us in this modern world, that would be unimaginable."

        "content": "Today, many men, women and children are overweight. This is the direct consequence of our modern lifestyle where many physical chores and activities are taken over by machines and energy-saving devices. No longer do we have to chop firewood, fetch water from the well, wash clothes with our hands, or get on our hands and knees to scrub the floor. These are all taken care of by gas stoves, piped water, washing machines, vacuum cleaners etc.\nAlso we do not have to hunt for our dinner, toil in the field, or herd the sheep. Modern machines and farming methods have mostly replaced physical labor. So many of us, without the physical exertions that burn up energy and keep us lean, become overweight.\n\nAt first glance, overweight people may not appear to have any problem, but behind their chubby faces and pot-bellies, they are just medical time-bombs waiting to go off. An overweight person has increased risks of falling prey to hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, cancer and many other debilitating diseases. These potentially deadly conditions are in addition to the sheer weight that the person have to lug around every day, making it hard to walk for a distance, climb stairs, or even just to get up from a chair.\n\nI know some overweight people and very one of them already has some kind of physical or health problem. One of my classmates is grossly overweight. While we run and play in the field, he just sits under the tree because he cannot keep up with us. He gets breathless easily and has to rest. My overweight uncle spends most of his time in front of the idiot box munching yet another box of snacks. He is a real 'couch potato'. Already he ahs had a couple of toes amputated because of his diabetic condition. Yet he does not exercise or do something to reduce his weight.\n\nBuying clothes off the rack is also another problem for the overweight person. They usually have to have their clothes specially tailored. This incurs greater expenses. Furthermore the range of clothes they can choose from is limited to the skill of their tailor.\n\nBeing overweight is certainly no fun, and is definitely hazardous to health. Unless the person has some kind of illness that causes him or her to be overweight, it is possible to reduce one's weight with proper diet and exercises. It is better to keep within the normal range and stay healthy as much as possible. We do not need weight problems. Living is much more pleasant and enjoyable without them."

The inevitable result of this congestion is the increase in the number of road accidents. Every day many road users get injured or killed. The dangers on the road are many. It is wise to know what they are and how to avoid them.\nIn towns and cities where the congestion is the greatest, pedestrians are the ones with the highest risks. Flesh is no match against metal or plastic. To be hit by a vehicle almost certainly means injury, or death. Sow hen crossing the streets, it is always better to use the pedestrian crossings that are usually located at junctions, regardless of whether the crossings have light or not. Even so be sure to observe the vehicles on the road before crossing. There are some drivers who do not stop at pedestrian crossings. Cross only when you know it is safe to do so, not because the light is green for you. If there are overhead pedestrian bridges, better still. Use them even though it might be a bit inconvenient. It is better to be safe than sorry.\n\nDashing across the street anywhere you like is a dangerous act. You might get away with it a thousand times, but it takes only one accident to put you down, temporarily or permanently. The consequences are terrible, as accident victims will testify to.\n\n\"Speed kills\", as the warning signs on highways say. How true it is. Accidents occurring along the highways are frequently fatal. Sometimes entire families are wiped out in a single accident. The vehicles are reduced to unrecognizable mangled heaps of metal. It is common to read about how the fire department \"took an hour to remove the bodies from the wreckage\". Do not speed on the road. This is the lesson to be learned.\n\nDespite the horror, many road users have not learned the lesson. They continue to speed and behave recklessly. This is especially so with young motorcyclists. With their devil-may-care attitude and their illegal midnight races, they not only endanger themselves but other road users as well. You will be well-advised to stay clear of them.\n\nWhen on the road, know the dangers and avoid them. In the first instance, do not endanger other road users with irresponsible behavior such as jaywalking, using the mobile phone while driving and beating red lights. Irresponsible road users are the greatest danger on the road. Do not let yourself be one."

I would highly recommend that all of you read this book.\nFirst, the plot is very touching. A young girl of five was left with her gruff and friendless grandfather up in the Alps. However, there grew a bond between the two of them. Heidi loved running around in the mountains with her friend, Peter, the goatherd and the goats. Then one day, her aunt came back and forcibly took her back to the city to stay with the invalid daughter of a rich man. Heidi pined for her grandfather and home in the Alps.\n\nI also like the way the characters are drawn. I can feel Heidi's joy in running around the mountains and her sadness being confined in a huge house. The other major characters are Grandfather, Peter, Clara and Grandmother and Dete. The author describes each character so that you can picture them in your mind.\n\nDespite being intimidated by the strict and rigid housekeeper, Heidi manages to retain her own identity and beliefs. This is a major theme of the book.\n\nAnother theme is the generosity of Heidi as seen against the selfishness of her Aunt Dete as well as the housekeeper. The author's message is not to impose our ideas of what is proper or right on others.\n\nThough there seems to be a lot of emphasis on the importance of prayer, the story is fast-moving and you will get immersed in Heidi's activities and problems. The story is well written. Dialogue used is very effective. Johanna Spyri understands the world of the young and the elderly.\n\nFinally, this is one of the best novels I have read. I would recommend it to anyone of any age. Find out for yourself what happens to Heidi."

He waits for me at the gate to welcome me home. When I feel depressed, he will play with me to cheer me up. If I am not in the mood, he will just nuzzle up against me to comfort me.\n\nYes, I do enjoy being with my friends. However, I do agree that a man's best friend is still his dog."

        "content": "If school were to start later, at 9.30 a.m., not the unearthly hour of 7.30 a.m., everyone would look forward to school.\nFirstly, to be at school by 7.30 a.m. would mean that we have to drag ourselves up by 6.00 a.m., if not 5.30 a.m. The thought of trudging to school in the dark is enough to drive all joy away. Moreover, before the morning is over, students are tired and drooping. How can any learning take place when we cannot even keep our eyes open?\n\nSecondly, teenagers who have insufficient sleep cannot do well at school. We all know that sleep is food for the brain. Teenagers need at least nine hours of sleep each night to function best. Being sleep-deprived, their brains cannot absorb information. They cannot solve problems. They are grouchy and grumpy. Traditionalists may say this is just an excuse. School has started at 7.30 a.m. since ages ago. Just go to bed earlier. However, sleep specialists have researched that hormonal changes in teenagers keep them awake until quite late. Biological sleep patterns shift later and later for adolescents. It is natural for them not to be able to sleep before 11.00 p.m.\n\nThirdly, many teenagers miss breakfast to get to school on time. We all know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and should not be missed. In addition, teenagers can have bonding time with parents if school starts later. They can take their time over breakfast with their parents. Many working parents come home late. By which time they are too tired to want to do more than have a meal and rest.\n\nIn conclusion, authorities should not be afraid to make changes. If school were to start later, students will definitely do better at school."

Asraf is Azreen's friend and the Old Lady agrees to help him, although she is greatly misunderstood and mistreated. However, after a few days, Asraf's grandmother passed away. Asraf is overcome with grief and he is swayed by the angry words of the villagers who believe that the Old Lady is a witch. He cannot think clearly and gives in to his uncontrolled feelings of sadness and rage. Asraf and the villagers go to the Old Lady's house to confront her.\n\nAzreen runs to the Old Lady's house to stop them. During her scuffle with Asraf, he accidentally drops the torch he is holding and sets the house on fire. The Old Lady is trapped inside. Before she dies, she tells Azreen to remember all that she has taught her and learn to forgive. The Old Lady remains calm even though she is trapped under a beam and manages to still give Azreen some words of advice.\n\nAsraf later regrets his actions, which he knows are caused by grief, but it is too late. If Asraf had remained calm, then he would not have listened to the villagers who were frightened by old rumours. The villagers are quick to look on the negative side of things and accuse the Old Lady of wrongdoing. Asraf should have taken some time to think and remember the Old Lady's kindness instead of acting irrationally.\n\nThis event has shown me the importance of staying calm and being in control of our thoughts and actions so that we will not regret later."

        "content": "An important lesson I learned in Step by Wicked Step by Anne Fine is that children need love and care as they are the ones who suffer the most in a family break-up. Children need love and care for they are dependent on their parents during their growing years. They think that their parents will be there for them always and when parents go their different ways or newcomers come into the family, they feel let down and sad.\nRichard is quite devastated when his father dies and his mother marries the cold and harsh Reverend Coldstone who turns out to be mean and wicked to him. He feels left out while his sister tries to adjust to the new situation. He feels that he cannot do the same. He feels that his mother is also not there for him and so he runs away from home.\n\nClaudia feels miserable to see her parents fighting and is bitterly hurt when her parents break up. No doubt she adjusts to the new situation after a while but others do not react the same way as she does. Colin likes his stepfather but his mother takes him away from him and so Colin ends up suffering a great deal. He spends his life longing to be with his stepfather again.\n\nRalph, on the other hand, enjoys the love of his many stepmothers and siblings. There is much disorder in his family but the fact that there is care and love among the members keeps him and the family going. Pixie has to struggle through some emotions and make adjustments to understand that she is loved by her father and stepmother. Robbo accepts his stepfather more readily than his sister does. His sister does not care for their stepfather and she returns to her father. All these examples show that children instinctively look for love and care and need lots of reassurance. When that is missing, they feel devastated and are likely to suffer and face great difficulty in adapting to a changed family situation."

There was much gloom in the little wooden house they called home.\nThe whole family had to work on the farm to get enough vegetables and fruits to sell at the market. Minah went to the nearby school in the morning and when she returned she would rush through her homework before she helped her parents. They had no luxuries and there was very little time to rest or do anything else. At times, Minah and her brothers had barely enough food to eat.\n\nPerhaps it was seeing her parents working so hard without any complaints or the sight of her brothers sitting with their books late at night, but whatever it was Minah was determined to do well in life. Minah's parents loved their children and encouraged them to work hard at school. Her older brothers managed to complete their secondary education but Minah had a dream. Every time she walked past the university in her town, she told herself that she would get a degree. It was a burning desire that she nursed in her heart.\n\nMinah did well in school and passed the exams with good results. Her teachers encouraged and advised her to apply for a scholarship. Minah did exactly that. To her joy, she managed to get a scholarship to study agriculture. It was a field that was close to her heart and it was no surprise that she did brilliantly in the university. Minah took a job that paid well and was able to help her family considerably.\n\nSome years later, Minah started a research centre in a rural area and was able to employ other people to work for her. Her centre did well and she was often invited to give talks to people interested in this field. She presented papers on various aspects of agriculture and was soon recognised as an authority on the subject. Minah had made it. She was a success."

        "content": "The domestic cat or house cat is a small domesticated animal that is beautiful and confident. It is often kept as an indoor pet. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rats, lizards and all sorts of household pests. A genetic study in 2007 revealed that domestic cats are descended from African Wildcats circa 8000 BCE, in the Middle East.\nSince cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic. According to research, cats are the most popular household pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where people live.\n\nCats have strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws and teeth that are adapted to killing small prey. They are predatory in nature. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice. They can see in near darkness and have an acute sense of smell. Like most other mammals, cats can't see colours the way humans can.\n\nDespite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication includes mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as other types of cat-specific body language.\n\nJust like dog shows, there are cat shows for pedigree cats. Breeding here is done in a controlled manner, where only the best males and females are bred for a limited number of times. However, failure\nto control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering can cause serious problems as cats breed very rapidly. Furthermore, the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control."

At the young age of sixteen she decided that she would not let her family suffer poverty. She forged ahead with the harvest and made sure the livestock was well fed.\n\nShe got help from the local Mardi and Felda officers who gave her the financial and practical backing. Despite her busy and complicated life, she still managed to continue with her schoolwork. Her mother sold cakes and tended to the fruit orchard that supplemented their income in the dry season. As she worked, Sarimah didn't neglect her siblings. She paid a kind teacher in the village some money to tutor them. She started selling handicrafts obtained from the local villagers at the weekend markets in K.L. There were times when she would cry herself to sleep.\n\nSoon she could manage the farm, orchard and her studies as she had engaged some Siamese odd jobbers to tend to the fields. This gave her time to study and look after the family. Her business evolved and she managed to study agribusiness in UPM. Nevertheless she returned to the village and saw her siblings through college. Today, all of them have successful careers of their own. Her father and mother now live a simple but comfortable life.

I am honoured and happy to speak to you about the benefits of the Interact Club.\nAs you know the Interact Club was formed to support the international aspirations of Rotary International, a well-known establishment that has carried out various social programs to promote better understanding among people. Rotary's programs for students and youth can change the lives of those who participate. Through these programs, young people can earn scholarships, travel on cultural exchange, or help a community through a service project.\n\nFirstly, you should join the Interact Club because it promotes understanding among people of diverse backgrounds, cultures and religions. This is vital in a plural society like Malaysia. Then, there is social responsibility. Our club visits orphanages, homes for the aged, and conducts other activities such as clean-ups in public areas. This is to inculcate a love for our environment which is being threatened by the ignorance and selfishness of the majority.\n\nAs I mentioned in my introduction, the Interact Club promotes sharing and caring through networking. The captains of industry, businessmen and women, professionals and other working adults from the Rotary community provide a strong network that spans the globe in supporting young people with activities that promote sharing knowledge, culture and opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that the Interact Club is a beneficial club to join with many advantages. So on a parting note, I bid you welcome. Thank you."

Shuttles will take the children from one building to another. There will be sky bridges connecting buildings and, therefore, students and teachers can access all the different facilities easily.\n\nAll the classrooms will be equipped with facilities of technology so that learning will be an exciting experience. There will be a chance to gain hands-on experience as students will get to go on field trips regularly. Children will learn at their own pace and thus there will be less pressure to keep up with others. A vibrant learning environment will make school an attractive place of children.\n\nTeachers will be facilitators and will assist children to acquire knowledge as robots or machines cannot replace the human factor. Naturally, teachers will still be needed to teach human values and emotional growth as machines cannot be a substitute in that aspect. Only human beings can impart feelings and ensure that students understand their role in the world as caring and responsible inhabitants of this planet.\n\nThe school of the future will make sure that the students leave school with the necessary skills to fit the employment market and be good citizens of the country.

When we first moved in, she was the first to come over and introduce herself, holding a hot plate of meehoon in her hand. Her warmth and joy was a welcome change from our previous neighbors. Since then, she has become a regular visitor to our home.\n\nWe soon discovered that Mak Cik Salmah did not have any children and so, she doted on us like we were her own. She insisted that we call her Opah and we became her first Chinese grandchildren. When I was young, I used to look forward to her visits as she would always hand me some goodies which she keeps in between her sarong belt.\n\nMak Cik Salmah is never content unless her hands are occupied. Whenever she comes over for a chat, she always brings along some chores to do. Her favorite is to peel anchovies. The more interesting the conversation, the faster she would peel. In no time, her lap would be filled with anchovies. Then, she would get up and dust her sarong the minute the clock strikes six. \"It's late. I have to go. Pak Din will be expecting dinner soon,\" she would proclaim. However, she always lingers for another fifteen minutes or so, as if she was reluctant to go back to her lonely home.\n\nOur day is never complete without Mak Cik Salmah's stories about the Japanese Occupation. She was just a little girl then but she remembers her time spent in the jungle vividly. She keeps us mesmerized with her stories, which are often scary as well as hilarious. As I grow older, I often wonder whether she makes up all those stories. Nevertheless, the children love her.\n\nApart from her ability to spin stories, Mak Cik Salmah is also a great cook. Her acar timun and otak-otak is well-known in our neighborhood. Whenever there is a wedding feast or kenduri, she is called upon for her services.\n\nThe most wonderful thing about Mak Cik Salmah is her ability to see some good in the worst character. So, whenever I got into trouble with my parents, I would turn to her for advice. She would listen without condemning me but at the same time, she would help me see my parents' point of view. In a way, she has been a great influence in my life and I am very fortunate to have such a great Opah."

She had taken me aside after a church choir practice last Thursday and slapped me with an appointment with her. I shouldn't have opened my mouth so wide while singing.\nSuddenly, a nurse called my name. I felt like a sheep to be slaughtered as she ushered me into the room. Dr Tan was smiling sweetly but she looked intimidating in her white overcoat. \"Just tell me when you are going to take it out,\" I pleaded nervously. She donned her mask and looked downright serious. I opened my mouth to show her where the affected tooth was. She made some small talk but I could only nod in response. Then, she injected some anaesthetic. \"Does it hurt?\" she asked. I was stunned momentarily by the ant-bite sensation. Then, she ushered me to a chair. \"Wait here till the medicine takes effect,\" she said.\n\nWhile waiting, I felt my lips growing bigger. Dr Tan continued her chit-chatting with her patient while drilling his tooth. Dentists are weird. They ask you questions that need more than a one word answer and at the same time they are working inside your mouth. This was the first time I saw the other side of her. However, I did not have time to dwell on that as another more pressing matter was before me. By the end of the ten minutes I was pretty sure everyone was looking at my lips.\n\nI was back on the chair again. She knocked on the affected tooth. \"Does it hurt?\" she asked again. By now, I couldn't feel anything. \"I'm just going to loosen the tooth a bit first,\" she continued. I felt her moving here and there. \"Now, rinse your mouth,\" she said. After that, I sank back into the chair reluctantly. \"It's done,\" she announced. \"Here is your tooth,\" she said as she shoved a little dish into my hands.\n\nI could not believe my eyes. The tooth was huge although one of its roots was gone. I slipped out of the chair, still dazed by it all. I waved goodbye and she patted me on my back. Before I could say anything, she had already nodded at her next patient. On my way out of the room, the nurse gave me some painkillers and some cotton. \"Remember your appointment next week,\" she reminded. How could I forget? The drill would be waiting for me next week but the thought that Dr Tan would be attending to me somehow made it seem less frightening. I would certainly be in good hands."

In my town, the night market is held once a month along the street in the middle of the town. The whole street is closed to traffic on the first Saturday of every month. This is the only night when the town comes alive.\nThe first to arrive at the site are the hawkers, stall owners and wholesalers who come in lorries and vans to unload their goods. The next hour is spent arranging their wares on their makeshift stalls. Soon, the whole place is transformed into a big shopping centre, brightly illuminated by flourescent lamps and colorful bulbs.\n\nMany shoppers flock to the night market to get their vegetables. There are a few vegetable stalls offering fresh vegetables at affordable prices. Housewives would quickly snap up the fresh vegetables after some bargaining. Later in the night, one can buy these vegetables at discounted prices as vendors try to finish their stock for the night. It is funny to see them trying to outdo one another, shouting on top of their voices, \"Satu ringgit, tiga ikat...\"\n\nApart from vegetables and fruit, there are also food stalls. The aroma of freshly fried chicken, ayam panggang, yong tow foo, fish balls, and laksa is enough to tempt any fussy eater. As for children, there are ice cream stalls, burgers, and sweets of all shapes and sizes.\n\nAt the other end of the street, there will be a few textile stalls. There is also a famous second-hand stall which sells cheap jeans and jackets. For those who cannot afford to get a new pair of jeans, this is the place to shop. There is also a famous makcik who sells trendy clothes, colorful scarves and tudung of various patterns and colors.\n\nShoppers who flock to the night market come from as far as the nearby towns. Some are here to shop and hunt for bargains while some are here to take a leisurely stroll on a Saturday night. The youngsters would take this time to hang out with their friends, enjoying the fiesta-like atmosphere.\n\nSome nights, one can come across interesting personalities who try to sell their wares with a microphone, encouraging and urging buyers to choose any three items for RM10. One can also come across the medicine man, crouching mysteriously in one corner, selling medicine to cure some illnesses or to increase one's strength.\n\nBy 10.30 p.m. the crowd slowly dwindles. Usually, there is litter everywhere. Our night markets are quite different from the flea markets of Europe. They offer not only cheap items for sale but also a variety of goods. One can call it a 'one-stop shopping centre' of Malaysia."

She says that I am not ready but we both know that she is terrified that a car would knock me down.\nWhen I reached the bus station, it was nearly empty except for a handful of boys. Mohan and I strode to a bench near the stationmaster's office. I could feel the tension on my shoulders as the straps of my school bag ate into my shoulders. \"Where is the bus?\" I sighed to myself. An elderly woman came and asked me where I was going. She started a conversation but gave up after my monosyllabic answers.\n\nSuddenly, someone shouted and I saw a bus swerve into the station. I got up, thankful for the chance to escape from the woman. It was Mohan's bus. The group of boys were jostling each other to get into the bus. \"Masuk! Masuk!\" shouted the conductor but nobody seemed to be moving. The black fumes made me nauseous. All of a sudden, people started appearing from all directions to board their bus. In no time, the passengers were packed like sardines in the bus. It started to move, leaving some unfortunate passengers behind. I waved at Mohan when I noticed him dangling on the steps of the bus. The bus swerved out of the station again. It left another trail of black smoke.\n\nI decided to go to Panjang's ice stall nearby. The iced sugarcane juice soothed my parched throat as I sipped slowly, all the while keeping an eye out for the bus. Then I saw the bus heading towards the station. I paid for my drinks. \"See you tomorrow,\" I waved to Panjang.\n\nOnce more, the crowd began to swell near the bus. I noticed that the elderly woman was being shoved around by the boys. She started hitting them with her umbrella. Then, I saw Raja, my classmate at the back of the bus. I hurled my bag through the window and he caught it. By the time I got into the bus, it had already started moving. I got into my seat and told myself that I must really try to convince my mother about the motorcycle again."

Little did I know that it would be the last time I would see him alive.\n\nLater that night, I received a call from Aunty Grace. She told me that Charles had been admitted to the hospital for suspected dengue fever. Then, she paused for what seemed like ages and said in a tearful voice, \"Charles has left us. He slipped into a coma and never regained consciousness.\" I do not recall how I spent the rest of the night. I only remembered calling our friends and we went to Charles's house.\n\nI looked at my friends who were writing furiously and I wondered whether they were struggling like me. I glanced at my watch and realized that it was already 10.30 in the morning. We would be going for the funeral service in about an hour. How was I going to say goodbye to my dear friend, my mentor and my counselor? He was there for me when my father passed away three years ago and he had always been like a big brother to me. I could still hear his jokes, his clowning around with us after the exam. How could I not know that he was sick?\n\nThe examination hall was unusually quiet. Miss Jeya signaled us to get into her car. Tears blurred my vision. I suddenly remembered the last time we were together in her car. We were going for a debate and Charles was our first speaker. He made us laugh at his antics till our sides ached.\n\nAt the service, Aunty Grace looked calm as we took our places. Then, it was time for my presentation. I took a deep breath. I wanted to say a few words before my song but I choked. Aunty Grace looked at me and smiled encouragingly. Then, I sang 'Amazing Grace', Charles's favorite song. \"I once was lost, but now am found, was blind but now I see.\" As my voice soared, I knew Charles was listening and I felt at peace, Goodbye, my friend, till we meet again. I shall never forget this day for the rest of my life."

Students are required to join at least one uniformed unit and a club. In my opinion, these activities play an important role in a student's life and are therefore not a waste of time and money.\nFirst and foremost, co-curricular activities provide a broadening experience for students to learn about themselves, other people, and the community at large through the various activities organized such as camping, school trips, games, project work and campaigns. For example, when students go on a study tour, they are given a chance to encounter situations and opportunities in the real world, beyond the school gate.\n\nApart from that, co-curricular activities provide students with a chance to develop other aspects such as music, sports and other living skills. Some students are unable to shine in the classroom but they are superb athletes and musicians. Confined to the demands of their studies, they are unable to develop their talents and may be branded as failures. Co-curricular activities help these students to become fulfilled individuals.\n\nBesides that, these activities provide leadership training for students. They get a chance to learn how to lead a team. They learn organizational skills such as planning, budgeting and problem-solving, all of which the classroom situation may be unable to provide. They learn discipline and co-operation, tolerance and understanding.\n\nIn addition, co-curricular activities provide an outlet for students to rest and relax after a hard day's work. Students get to play, laugh and release their tension through the various club activities held, such as quizzes, treasure hunts and various games. As there are many types of clubs and societies, there is almost something for everyone. For those who do not like outdoor games, they can always join a chess club or a cookery club. For the active and restless, they can join the football club or the netball club. Various competitions and selections are held and some students are picked to represent their schools.\n\nCo-curricular activities certainly play an important role in a student's life. They complement the activities of the classroom. In a nutshell, a well-planned co-curricular program helps students become wholesome individuals. Thus, co-curricular activities are definitely not a waste of time and money."

Some are good at their job but some have made my life downright miserable.\nWhat makes an effective teacher? First and foremost, he (or she) must be knowledgeable in his (or her) own field. Pupils quickly lose respect for teachers who are unable to answer a simple question or solve a simple problem related to their field. They should also be honest with pupils if they do not know the answer and make efforts to improve themselves.\n\nApart from that, an effective teacher should also be able to impart his knowledge to his pupils. I once had an Additional Mathematics teacher who was a genius but he could not tell us clearly how he solved mathematical problems. Such a teacher is of no use to pupils. An effective teacher is able to simplify a difficult concept and help pupils to understand them. He is able to teach even weak pupils.\n\nFurthermore, he should also continue to keep abreast with the latest developments in his field and the world in general. It is rather embarrassing when pupils seem to know more about what is going on in the world than the teachers who seem contented using the same notes year in and year out.\n\nMoreover, an effective teacher is also a fair teacher. He does not show favoritism among his pupils. He treats everyone equally regardless of creed, race or intelligence. There is nothing worse than teachers who pay extra attention to pupils who are more intelligent.\n\nFinally, an effective teacher is also one who does not allow his personal life to interfere with his work at school. He is able to put aside his worries and concentrate on the task at hand in school. If a teacher is constantly worried about his personal problems, he cannot be totally committed to his pupils and such teachers are more ineffective.\n\nTeachers play such an important role in a pupil's life. An effective teacher is someone who is a role model - who not only educates his pupils but also ignites and inspires them towards becoming wholesome individuals."

        "content": "Finally, the day you have been dreading has arrived - the all important SPM exam. You have checked out the examination hall and your assigned seat. After so many months of preparation and studies, it is time to face the examination.\nHow do you face such an important day? Firstly, prepare a test kit for the duration of your examination. In your bag, collect all your supplies such as 2B pencils, several pens and other important stationery, a calculator, your geometry set, the important identity card and your examination slip. Put the bag and everything else that you might need, including some notebooks, in one place. This will help to reduce your worries in the morning.\n\nMany students find difficulty sleeping especially if they are facing their first examination. Allow your body to get back to its normal cycle at least a week before the examination if you have been staying up late. Listen to some relaxing music or your favorite radio station before you sleep. Try to relax and remember to set your alarm clock.\n\nBe determined to arrive early at the examination hall. You have enough to worry about in the morning of the big day. When you arrive at the hall, surround yourself with friends who are supportive or just go through your notes quietly. If you do not know the answer to any topic, do not go round asking frantically for the answer. This will just upset you and send you into panic mode.\n\nWhen you are at the examination hall, follow these steps. Before the examination starts, make sure your question paper is complete. Read the instructions carefully. Do not worry if you cannot answer the very first question or if your mind goes blank. Tell yourself that it will all come back. Tackle the easy questions first. Divide your time carefully for each question and move on to the next question even if you have not finished the first. Plan your answer and try to be neat.\n\nFinally, after each paper, go home and rest. Do not worry about what you could have done or did not do. Try not to discuss the answers with your friends. You should not allow anything to upset the rest of the examination."

        "title": "Stress",
        "content": "Stress is defined as a person's response to his environment. Symptoms of stress include exhaustion, loss of/increased appetite, headaches, crying, sleeplessness, and oversleeping. Feelings of alarm, frustration, or apathy may accompany stress. Working adults often face work-related stress. What is even more alarming is that more and more children are also suffering from stress.\nThere are many ways in which we can reduce stress in our lives. Firstly, get up fifteen minutes earlier each morning. That gives you a little more time to eat something, run back to get something you may have forgotten, or enjoy a cup of coffee before heading out the door. If you drive to work, a 15- or 20-minute head start may mean facing less traffic, thus making the journey less stressful.\n\nThe next thing that we can do to reduce stress is to confide in someone we trust. Don't keep things bottled up. Talking with someone helps you to put things in better perspective. Who knows, they may even have solutions to your problems. Do not be afraid to seek professional help if you feel you have reached breaking point.\n\nBesides that, learn how to relax. Meditation and breathing exercises have proved to be very effective in controlling stress. Practice clearing your mind of disturbing thoughts. The quickest and most effective way of eliminating feelings of stress and panic is to close your eyes and take several long, slow, deep breaths. Breathing in this way calms your whole nervous system. Simultaneously, you could give yourself some mental pep-talk by mentally repeating \"I am calm and relaxed\" or \"I know I will be fine\".\n\nFinally, learn to set your priorities right and do not over-commit yourself. People who are over-committed tend to feel overwhelmed and suffer. Reduce the number of events going on in your life and you may reduce the circuit overload. Set realistic goals for yourself and put it in writing. Do not worry over the small stuff but reward yourself when you have been successful in achieving even some small goals.\n\nSome say that a little stress is good for you as it pushes you to react and achieve your goals. On the other hand, when stress is prolonged, it causes physical and emotional problems that may damage both your health and your performance. Thus, it is important for us to learn how to handle our stress."

        "content": "Movies are an absolute joy to watch, With the action-packed fight sequences coupled with romantic and light-hearted moments, it is understandable to know why watching movies is such a popular pastime. However, what keeps me glued to the screen is the acting. Without good actors, the movie would be nothing. There are many actors and actresses whom I love to watch. However, my favorite actor is Tom Cruise.\nTom Cruise first shot to fame with his portrayal of Ethan Hunt in the great hit movie Mission Impossible. The movie's success was credited mostly to its engaging storyline, high-tech gadgetry and Tom Cruise's talented acting. The success of Mission Impossible resulted in the release of two sequels to the film which did equally well worldwide. All these movies presented Tom Cruise's ability to perform gravity-defying, gun-wielding stunts himself which almost rendered the stuntman obsolete. The only other actor who performed dangerous stunts was Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones.\n\nBesides acting in high-octane action movies, Tom Cruise has also acted in heartwarming movies such as Jerry Mcguire. His role in the movie as a lawyer and executive was executed to near perfection. I can remember nearly succumbing to tears as I watched his role facing repeated failures before achieving victory. The movie garnered much support from both fans and critics of the actor. Tom Cruise then, much to my delight, went on to win an Oscar for his performance in the movie.\n\nTom Cruise's personal life is just as extraordinary as his acting career. Most of his friends are celebrities who include David Beckham and Oprah Winfrey. He had been seen going out with most of Hollywood's A-list actresses before finally tying the knot with Nicole Kidman. The couple adopted two children before going their separate ways. Tom Cruise then married Katie Holmes, another up-coming actress.\n\nHe has been in the movie scene for almost two decades but shows no sign of retiring. He has never ceased to enthrall audiences with his acting prowess and I, as well as millions of fans round the world, hope to see more of his movies in cinemas worldwide."

        "content": "The massive flood that started on 22 of December will be forever etched in my mind. The floods destroyed and caused heavy damage to 700 homes and displaced 90,000 people in my village. With the area having only a population of 25,000, it was a significant number of flood victims. The immediate problems that had to be addressed were water, sanitation and health issues. As many of the district health centers had been destroyed or damaged, water-purification tablets and water tanks were urgently needed. Various humanitarian bodies distributed anti-malaria medication and insecticide-treated bed nets.\nAlthough these were essential in maintaining the general health of the victims, the grief openly displayed in their faces was more worrisome. Some just did not want to be consoled or even counseled. The loss of loved ones, babies, husbands and siblings snatched by the fury of the rising waters were too difficult to even consider. As food supplies trickled in, victims stampeded the volunteers. Brute force was needed to keep the desperate at bay in order to give every victim the opportunity to receive the required aid. Relief efforts were also hampered due to the lack of communication and greed of some profiteers. Their greed in times of distress sickened me to the core.\n\nThe flood had been traumatic for many children. They felt isolated because of the deep mud left by the floods. Many were not able to leave their homes, play outside or go to school. Their usually cheerful faces were replaced with forlorn faces that had not quite grasped the extent of the devastation. Many others were also traumatized by the water, refusing to leave their homes. I had to beg and cajole to get them to leave their mud-caked huts to join us in the sampans that would carry them to relief centers.\n\nI am grateful that I survived the flood without losing any of my family members. We lost our home and belongings, but nothing can replace the life of a loved one. This traumatic experience taught me many things. Among the most important were to cherish my family and to be strong in all adversity."

During the school holidays, my father bought two tickets to watch the Selangor versus Perak match. There was a sea of people waiting to collect their tickets an hour before the match. My father and I were uncomfortably sandwiched between them but managed to enter on time.\nThe stadium was packed like sardines when we entered. People could be seen jostling through the excited crowd to get to their seats. There were even a few people who were armed with umbrellas, ready to deploy them upon sight of rain. As my dad and I were looking for our seats, I could see a few voluntary policeman stationed round the stadium to control the frenzied crowd.\n\nSoon, the match kicked off and I watched the game with interest. My father had bought a bandana and scarf bearing Selangor's name prior to the game. I wore them proudly and cheered for my team happily. The spectators screamed and yelled each time their teams gained and lost possession of the ball. Caught in the moment, I too yelled as loud as I could with the expense of a sore throat the next day. Fortunately, my enthusiastic cheering was not a complete disappointment as Selangor scored its 1st and 2nd goal in the first 20 minutes of the match.\n\nHowever, skill and luck seemed to shift to the Perak side as the team scored another two goals. This left the score at 2 all at half-time. During the half-time break, my father bought a few drinks to moisten our parched throats due to excessive cheering. The match resumed just after we finished our burgers. We were delighted to see our team doing their best.\n\nThe game ended in my team's favor as Selangor clobbered Perak 5-2. The stadium then emptied almost as fast as it was filled. I had a whale of a time watching the match with my father. The experience was amazing and I am sure my brothers are green with envy as they had to study for their examinations instead."

My first thought was that there was a power disruption due to the thunderstorm brewing outside. Instinct led me to the kitchen cabinet where I could remember my mother storing some candles for emergencies.\nAfter a considerable amount of groping, the tips of my fingers came into contact with a waxy candle. I grabbed it immediately with relief and quickly lit it. Then, I noticed that my neighbor's lights were on. This\ndiscarded my first notion of the power shortage due to the storm. I began to ponder what could be the cause of the blackout. Then, I remembered my father showing me a lamp in his room which used to cause the electrical supply in the house to go haywire for some inexplicable reason.\n\nI rushed to my father's room and inspected the lamp but found that it was disconnected. The sound of something being moved round upstairs instantly diverted my attention. The hairs behind my neck stood on ends. To ensure I was not seen by whoever was in the house, I quickly blew the flame off my candle.\n\nI furtively moved under the kitchen table and remained as quiet as a bat. The intruder went out of sight but I could hear his faint footsteps on the wooden staircase. Thoughts of me getting kidnapped crept uneasily into my mind. No more than a second later, I saw the garage door ploughed down by my neighbor, Mr Vasu. As the lightning flashed, he saw me hiding and hastily led me out of the house and into his.\n\nEverything seemed to happen at lightning speed. Mrs Vasu tried to calm me down and explained to me that Mr Vasu happened to see the thief rummaging the bedroom facing theirs. Apparently my parents had asked him to keep an eye on me while they were away.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, my parents were at Mr Vasu's house thanking him for rescuing me. From their conversation, I gathered that the thief managed to flee when he heard Mr Vasu storming through the door. Nevertheless, I was extremely grateful to Mr Vasu and will forever be indebted to him."

However, I was never bold enough to actually be a contestant in these competitions. The fear of forgetting my story, stuttering and stammering during my speech or failing the impromptu sessions frequently haunted me.\nAll the same, my English teacher, Mrs Ho, wheedled me into trying my luck at the district level public speaking competition. I was a little unnerved and stifled at first, but after some encouragement I felt I was up to the challenge. I practiced hard each day with the intention of claiming top honors at the competition. I did not want to give in to my foibles, but rose up to the occasion.\n\nSoon, I was on my way to the public speaking competition venue which was a a stone's throw away from my school. My prepared speech played endlessly in my head. I knew I had to execute each word with utter perfection. After some time, I started to feel a little more confident in my ability to memorize the story and was certain that I could clinch the first prize.\n\nThe hall I entered was filled with students and teachers, all of them looking intimidating. Looking up at Mrs Ho, she comforted me by smiling and advised me not to worry. I was the final contestant for my category. The waiting was sheer agony as I watched each contestant make their painful exit.\n\nHalf an hour later, a teacher told me it was my turn. Without delay, I got up on stage. The large crowd made me cringe a trifle but I managed to begin my speech flawlessly. Into the third minute of my eight-minute speech, I started forgetting my lines. Tiny droplets of perspiration began to trickle down my neck. My hands began to quiver. Suddenly, I was completely blank and the words of my story began to elude me. As people started pointing and looking at me, I quickly ran off stage and into the car park.\n\nMrs Ho quickly rushed towards me and tried to console me. She told me that what had happened was not something uncommon. Many students often go blank and freeze on stage. Nevertheless, that moment will forever be branded in my head as the most embarrassing moment of my life."

        "content": "Every year thousands and thousands of young adults leave the comforts of their homes to study in a foreign country such as the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia. There seems to be an\nelement of glamour involved. On the contrary, studying abroad has more benefits than just that. However, for every pro there is a con.\nFirst, let us look at the pros. Living in another country means leaving behind all the comforts of home and having to do everything for yourself. You would need to do things you may have never done in your home country. These include cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, washing clothes, figuring out transportation and making living arrangements. Many students go home proud that they have become very independent individuals. Achieving all this also improves self-esteem and builds strength of character. You will become more confident than ever. Your life will be forever changed.\n\nStudying in a foreign country also means having to speak English even more than what you are used to. Everywhere you turn, you will be exposed to the language - on the streets, in the stores, on campus - you can't get away from it. You will be forced to interact with the local people there in English apart from writing and reading the language on campus. The plus point here is that your English language proficiency will improve by leaps and bounds. The best way to learn or improve on a language is by using it daily. Studying abroad also has its cons. Almost everyone will experience some homesickness. You will probably miss your family, friends, food and everything familiar. Apart from that, there is culture shock. You will need to get accustomed to new attitudes and ways of life.\n\nOn the other hand, living in a different culture helps you to realize there are different ways of doing things. You will also discover that at the end of the day, we are all human with the same emotions. The friendships you form will help you reach a new level of maturity.\n\nDespite the disadvantages of studying abroad, the overall outcome is a positive one. What you can gain from this experience far outweighs the negative because there is no price for personal growth and realization."

        "content": "The day we learn to talk and socialize is the day we start making friends. As we grow up, we discover that there are many types of friends. Some are more of an acquaintance and a select few are confidantes. To me, the word `friend' is sacred. It means more than just a companion who goes for movies and have laughs over nothing with. A friend is someone I can turn to when I am down and will always stand by my side through thick and thin. What qualities do I look for in a friend?\nFirstly, my friend should always be caring. This means taking an interest in my problems no matter how big or petty they are. A friend gives me encouragement even when everyone else is against me. Many people say they are friends, but most of them run away the minute I am not cheerful or funny. A real friend sticks by me no matter what mood or predicament I am in. After all, isn't friendship about accepting and liking people for who and what they are?\n\nApart from that, a friend should be honest. This quality is crucial to me, because honesty builds trust. An honest friend will not lie and I must be able to trust the person with my secrets. Apart from that, sometimes I need an honest opinion about myself or an issue. If a friend is honest, I can trust that his or her opinion is not biased. This is very important to me, because although the truth may hurt it will help me to improve. Only an honest friend will be able to do that.\n\nBesides that, a friend must also be able to share the same humor with me. Humor plays an important role in making your day more lively and enjoyable. Friends who can joke and laugh over similar things make life so much more fun. As they say, laughter is the best medicine and brings much joy on dull days.\n\nI welcome everyone as my friend. However, I look for certain qualities which would make him or her a meaningful friend and someone I can count on. Among them would be honesty, a warm heart and the\nability to share and participate in the same humor."

Some don a long cane while others opt for the typical ruler. In general, the discipline teacher is said to be too strict. However, I find that the discipline teacher in my school is not.\nMr Tiva is a far cry from the typical discipline master. He is a tall and lean man who has held the discipline teacher position for the last two years. His concept of instilling good moral values into the delinquents of my school is not by force, but by communicating on the same level as them. His uncanny ability to understand why a pupil reacted a certain way has more than once surprised me.\n\nMoreover, he is a very friendly and compassionate teacher. Students never cease to enjoy his Mathematics classes as he never forgets to incorporate jokes into his lessons. However, he always knows when to divert his student's attention back to the subject. He uses unorthodox teaching methods to persuade us to study such as playing Mathematic games and organizing Maths carnivals. By doing so, he gained the respect of most of the students from my school.\n\nBesides that, Mr Tiva takes the liberty of visiting the homes of students who have disciplinary problems. He tries his best to analyze their surroundings and determine the root of the student's behavior. This technique often brings him success and he has helped many students overcome their problems. Parents have on many occasions, ridiculed him for blaming them for their children's bad behavior but those accusations are not true and can be substantiated with evidence.\n\nAll in all, Mr Tiva has contributed a lot to my school. After his takeover of the discipline teacher's position, there has been a sharp decline in truancy and vandalism. Many students here listen to Mr Tiva out of respect and not fear. They know that what he does is for their own benefit. Thus, I do not think that my discipline teacher is too strict."

If I were to become the next principal of my school, I would make some changes to the school infrastructure and facilities. First and foremost, I would build a functional and interactive computer lab. In this IT era, being well-versed in computers is a must to be one step closer to success in career advancement. This lab would be of great use to students who do not have a computer or whose family cannot afford to have one. Since this is the age where they learn new things quicker, it is the best time for them to learn about computers.\nNext, I would have extra classes over weekends and school holidays prior to major examinations. Extra classes will be conducted by teachers who are dedicated to helping weaker students. This would be of great help to poorer students who cannot afford to go for tuition.\n\nThe learning environment for students is also very important. The chairs and tables of some classrooms are in very bad condition. Some are old and some have been broken by irresponsible students. Thus, I would provide new and more comfortable tables and chairs. Nobody can study peacefully with a creaky chair and shabby desk. This would help them to be more comfortable and increase their attention span in class thus, indirectly improving his or her performance in school.\n\nThe next thing I would do is improve the quality of food served at the canteen. Currently, the type of food served is not very nutritional, very limited in choice, unhygienic and not tasty. Insects and fine pieces of dust can sometimes be seen floating on the beverages served. As the principal, I would impose more stringent rules on the cleanliness and suggest more variety in the choices of food. I would have a survey to determine the types of healthy food that should be served and make sure the canteen operators follow this guideline.\n\nSports play an important part in our lives. Hence, I would improve the quality of sports equipment and facilities in the school. This would give students, who are not very good academically, to explore and develop their sports talents. If they perform exceptionally well in sports, I might discover yet another Nicol David !\n\nThese are a few things I would do as a principal. Making the changes stated above will change how students perceive school and become more motivated to excel in their studies and in life."

However, the current generation of students would rather gain popularity than to work hard. Loitering is becoming rampant among them. Some even skip school to loiter. How do we address this?\nFirst and foremost, we cannot undermine the power of education. Parents should teach their children the importance of education. In school, teachers ought to instill the importance of studying hard for the sake of a bright future. Often, students do not understand the relevance of their actions in the present. Perhaps by listening to both parents and teachers, students will be able to realize that persevering in their studies will undoubtedly improve their lives in the future.\n\nBesides that, schools must increase the number of discipline teachers. Discipline teachers should also be given the green light to punish students who disobey any school rules or regulations. By doing so, students will be afraid to loiter and choose to stay in the classroom instead.\n\nMoreover, teachers should strive to include new methods of teaching in their daily lessons. Their teaching technique should always be upgraded to suit the changing needs of students. By doing so, the lesson in class becomes more enjoyable and students will be more interested to study. Interactive methods of teaching such as using computers and LCD will attract the attention of today's tech-savvy students.\n\nLast but not least, schools and the community could organize more interesting activities after school hours. If something interesting is happening, many youths would be attracted to participate. For example, if there is a talent contest or a dance competition, I am sure many of our youths would have no time for loitering. Co-curricular activities in school should also be more relevant and interesting in order to captivate their attention.\n\nThe problem of loitering has plagued many schools for a long time. Loitering can be solved if steps are taken immediately to curb it. The youths are our nation's future leaders and should be taken care of to ensure a prosperous nation."

The availability and quality of water determines not only where people can live, but also their quality of life. Even though there is plenty of fresh water, it is not available when and where it is needed. Only five per cent of the world's water is deemed fit for consumption and this figure is shrinking by the day. Thus, it must be treated as a limited and precious resource.\nWithout water, all human activity would be affected and come to a standstill. Water is essential for commercial use which includes fresh water for motels, hotels, restaurants, office buildings, other commercial facilities, and civilian and military institutions. Domestic water use would be for drinking, food preparation, bathing, washing, flushing toilets, and watering lawns and gardens. The other uses would be for industries such as power generators and for agriculture.\n\nThe availability of water dictates where and to what extent development can occur. Water must be in sufficient supply for an area to develop, and an area cannot continue to develop if demand for water outstrips supply. In the twenty-first century, the demand for water has to be managed more effectively within the available supply instead of simply building more dams.\n\nThe demand for water increases year by year as the human population grows bigger. However, the supply of clean, useable water does not. Instead, it shrinks due to pollution, deforestation and global warming. If a balance is not obtained, our source of water will diminish very fast.\n\nThere are several ways in which an individual can save this precious commodity. When washing dishes or hands, don't let the water run while rinsing. Run your washing machine and dishwasher only when they are full and you could save 1000 gallons of water. Minimize evaporation by watering plants early in the morning when the temperature is cooler. Replacing the traditional shower head with a water-saving one could save about a gallon of water each time.\n\nIt is said that one can survive a week without food, but only a few days without water. Since water is the source of all life, it is time great importance is placed to conserve."

        "content": "Drug abuse used to be a phrase commonly used for adults, but now it is becoming common among teenagers. Why does it occur among teenagers and what can be done about it?\nThere are psychological and social reasons. Some individuals have a genetic predisposition to becoming depressed due to stress and it is undeniable that teenagehood can be one of the most stressful stages of life. Such a psychiatric disposition could lead to drug addiction because drugs give the abusers relief from stress. Having tried it once, the sense of feeling high spurs the user to get a second fix and so on. Poor stress management and a low self-esteem could also trigger the use of drugs as the person simply wants to escape reality. The social reason comes in the form of peer pressure. In order to be accepted by a group, some teenagers succumb to peer pressure and get hooked on drugs.\n\nFollowing that, how can one help reduce the risk of teenage involvement in drug abuse? Getting to know a teenager's friends and their parents on a first name basis will also help a parent know what their teen is up to. Networking between parents of teenagers is essential. Keeping connected to their teens is also important. If a parent cannot be home with their teen, call and leave notes. Have another adult supervise him or sign him up for an after school program. If these things are not possible, establish a routine for the teenager to keep him busy.\n\nParents often avoid talking of drugs. They should. However, it must be reminded that these are conversations, not lectures that would bore teenagers. Instead, unite the family against drugs using strong family beliefs such as religious teachings. Establish that the family does not use drugs and there are other healthier ways to enjoy life and fix problems than escaping into a drug haze.\n\nIn doing so, the risks teenagers face against drugs, peer pressure to take drugs and the curiosity of taking drugs can be minimized, thereby creating a harmonious and healthy living environment for teenagers to\nthrive and excel in."

        "content": "In Malaysia, students receive at least 11 years of formal education before entering the job market. It is in school that students spend a major part of their growing years. School life can be an enjoyable experience for some while a torture for others. However, everyone needs to experience school life as education is compulsory in Malaysia and it is an offence if we do not attend school.\nMost children enjoy going to school in the early years of schooling. It is the time when they are exposed to people of all walks of life and diverse cultures which they will not be able to experience at home. During their early primary years, children will learn the basics in reading, writing and arithmetic while getting to know new friends. As they progress to later years in primary school, the students will be exposed to more complex subjects like History and Geography. This is to help them to understand the world better.\n\nIn secondary school, they are expected to be independent in their learning. However, it is during this time that they will experience changes physically and emotionally. The teenagers will need to adapt to these changes well as they have school projects and major examinations like Penilaian Menengah Rendah and Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia. It is during this time that they will make major decisions like choosing which stream to study as their decisions will influence their life career.\n\nSecondary school life will expose them to extra curricular activities that help them develop as an individual. Participation in dubs, societies, uniformed bodies and sports activities will develop their leadership skills and stimulate their interests in these activities. These skills and experiences will stand them in good stead in working life. After they complete Form 5 or Form 6, they have to prepare themselves to further their studies in university or college.\n\nSchool life is the time when students discover themselves while gaining skills and knowledge that would prepare them for the real world. It is up to the students to make their school life as interesting as possible, for once they pass that stage of their life, there is no turning back."

Early this year I got my results. I obtained 11As and a B in History. I am very elated but I guess I am not that good at remembering dates and names.\n\nI am sure you will be happy for me too. You are the first person I thought of after receiving my SPM results. You have encouraged me to read a lot and to improve my command of English. I was not that fluent before, but you have confidence in me. I read a lot and learnt a lot of new vocabulary. With that, I could write better and managed to achieve 1A in English Language and English in Science and Technology.\n\nI would also like to thank you for motivating me throughout my two years with you. You are my role model. You have given me endless inspiration. You also took me to motivational camps. There were two camps which I could not forget. Those were incredible camps. They were the Summer Camp and the other one is the Science Camp. I benefited tremendously from those camps and I am extremely grateful that you had taken me there. I have developed my self-confidence, discovered my abilities, and am not afraid to go beyond it. Thank you, teacher.\n\nTeacher, you are always there for me. You gave me sound advice when I was having problems. You always listened to my problems, my doubts and my uncertainties. I appreciate it so much. I remembered the time when I did not see eye to eye with Anis, you were there to help us patch up. Thanks to you, we are now the best of friends!\n\nMy mother once told me that a good teacher would not have second thoughts about making sacrifices for their students. I always doubt that. However, you have proven how wrong I was. You sacrificed your money and time for me. You paid my SPM fees when my father couldn't deliver the money on time. I was deeply touched at that time. You were willing to sacrifice your time to cheer me up when I failed my Biology and Chemistry papers in the trial examination. I was stubborn then, and refused to listen to anybody. Nonetheless, you made me listen to you. How could I ever repay you? Only God can.\n\nI plan to go to university and do Pharmacy. It has been my dream since I was small. I love being in the midst of wonder-working drugs, dispensing medicine and helping patients recover. I am sure the course will be challenging but I promise you, I will give my very best and will study extra hard to achieve my ambition.\n\nOnce again, my dear teacher, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to be the best and to be somebody.\n\nYours sincerely,"

This was followed by another speech by the principal who reminded students to study hard and develop good qualities. He also commended our teachers for their diligence and commitment. At the end of the speech, we clapped loudly to show our appreciation to our teachers.\n\nFor the next item, the class monitors read out the Teacher's Day message. This was then followed by our class parties. While eating, we sang, danced and played games. Some of us presented our class teachers with presents and roses. I gave my favorite teacher, Cik Aminah, a stalk of rose.\n\nAfter 11 a.m., the telematches started. Of course, this was the highlight of the day. The teachers and students played various interesting games. The games went on till 1 p.m. Not surprisingly, the students won most of the games.\n\nWe all enjoyed ourselves so much that day.

My heart felt like breaking into pieces seeing it lying there. Very quickly, I took the baby boy up and carried him. He did not look dirty. His mother or whoever must have just left him there.\n\nAfter some discussion, we decided to bring him to the nearest police station. There, we told the police inspector where we had found the baby. Then, we handed him over to the policeman.\n\nWhen we got home, we related to our parents what we had done. They were proud of us.

In your letter, you asked me about the people and religions in my country.\n\nI am happy to say that my country is a multi-racial country where there is religious freedom. It is home to people of different religions. The different religious groups have very different practices and religious festivals.\n\nThe Buddhists, for instance, observe the first and fifteenth days in the lunar calendar as religious days to offer prayers to Buddha. They go to the temples as early as five in the morning to pray. On these two days, they also fast or observe a vegetarian diet.\n\nAs for the Hindu devotees, they celebrate Thaipusam and Deepavali. When making a wish at the temple, they go through the ritual of praying and then breaking a coconut on the ground. Every day, they light a lamp at the altar of the gods as part of the ritual.\n\nThe Muslim males must attend prayers at the mosque on Fridays. On other days, both males and females pray five times a day. They do it in such a manner that they face the direction of the holy city of Mecca. During fasting month, they exercise self-discipline and fast while preparing for Hari Raya.\n\nAs for the Christians, they attend church for prayer and worship on weekends. Some groups hold Bible classes once a week. they celebrate Christmas in December every year.\n\nI hope I have given you some idea about the different religious groups in my country.

You are thinking of enrolling for this course.\n\nI have read about this course. So based on what I read, I can tell you what I know. Veterinary science is a medical profession that deals with the control of disease in animals. The primary responsibility of a veterinarian or doctor of animals is to look after the health and welfare of animals.\n\nThe demand for veterinary doctors has increased tremendously. More and more people are keeping pets, both for companionship and protection, than ever before. When their pets get sick or injured, they need to go to the veterinarians.\n\nVeterinary doctors diagnose the disease, prevent and control animal diseases, treat sick and injured animals, prevent the transmission of animal diseases to people and advise owners on proper care of their pets.\n\nA veterinarian should have a genuine love for animals. He must also be physically fit as working with large animals requires physical stamina and quick body reflexes. Other qualities are the ability to inspire confidence in animals, power of observation and self-reliance. So you need to ask yourself if you have these qualities before signing up for the course.\n\nYou can read up more about it online. I have to go now. You take care and all the best.\n\nYour friend,"

All your shirts and trousers are too tight now. Your weight gain has made you sluggish and lazy. I'm not surprised that you feel this way.\n\nWell, I have to tell you that you must stop putting on more weight. At your weight now, you are 25 kg overweight. This is going to cause you many health problems.\n\nIt is not difficult to get rid of some weight. All you need is to exercise some discipline. You will also need tons of willpower. Follow a strict program of healthy eating and exercise. Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables for they are a rich supply of vitamins, minerals and fiber. At the same time, you have to go easy on foods that are rich in fat and oil. Avoid sweet food like chocolate and cakes. Such food contains a lot of sugar and this will make you gain a lot of weight.\n\nEating healthy food must be accompanied by good eating habits as well. Take three meals a day at regular times. Eat a low-calorie breakfast. It can be toast and a glass of milk. For lunch, you can have a sandwich and an apple. Cut down on dinner for this is the last meal of the day. You don't need energy to sleep now, do you?\n\nAnd of course, you need to exercise. Take up walking, cycling or swimming. Exercise burns calories and builds up muscle.\n\nI hope you will follow my advice. It is guaranteed to help you lose weight. Do tell me if you have lost some weight.

As an effective means of solving this perennial problem, the government intervened and the GreatKL buses made their debut, replacing the problem-ridden Indreekota bus services in 2004.\n\nIndreekota charged bus commuters RM1 fare for quite a long trip to KL from suburban residential areas. However, GreatKL charged a flat rate of RM2 for the same route. This is double the old fare.\n\nIn the beginning, the bus service of GreatKL was good and punctual. The new buses provided a comfortable ride. Bus commuters were willing to pay the extra fare though it incurred more expenses on transport.\n\nBut all that was soon over. Currently, even though the buses are considered still new, punctuality-wise they are erratic and are getting worse by the day. those who depend on public transport, mainly buses, are left with no choice but to suffer in silence, having to bear the higher fare and suffer great inconvenience at having to wait too long for buses. The reasons often given by the operators are that there are not enough buses or the bus has broken-down somewhere.\n\nGiven this negative scenario, one wonders how the public, particularly the lower-income group, is now going to face up to the reality of having to dig deeper into their pockets. This will happen in view of an imminent fare hike which is bound to happen after the withdrawal of subsidy given to GreatKL Bus Service.\n\nBus commuter,"

A secondary objective is to encourage the residents in our community to recycle.\n\nOne such recycling program is the Kitar Semula program. Through this program, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government has placed more than 1000 recycling bins and established 65 recycling centers all over the country. The rubbish bins are found in public places like schools, petrol stations and shopping malls.\n\nSadly, there are still many people in our country who are not willing to go through this little inconvenience. To them, it is so much easier to chuck the recyclable materials into the garbage bin. And what is happening? Out of 30% of the solid waste generated by households that can be recycled, only 5% is being recycled. This is discouraging.\n\nPerhaps we should do what is being done in some parts of the United States. If the people do not recycle their recyclable waste, their garbage will not be collected. Moreover, they have to pay per bag of waste generated.\n\nI'm proud to say that the people in my area, Taman Cemerlang, have demonstrate their great support for recycling. We not only recycle but we have also managed to cut down on the amount of waste our community generates.\n\nSo, let us all do our part in this recycling drive.

        "content": "Videos, television and computers are effective electronic teaching tools especially in today's context. Our Ministry of Education has introduced the use of Computer Assisted Learning programs in many schools.\nThe use of videos and television certainly improves the learning process among students. Generally, young children and teenagers learn better and faster ,from the small screen than from the printed word. They absorb more from the screen. It does not matter what educational program they are reading or watching.\n\nThrough the Internet and the multiple formats communicated over the web, students have access to new and exciting ways of learning. The computer allows the incorporation of animation, moving pictures and sound into lessons. These multimedia resources present materials which encourage the learner's interaction with the subject matter. Pictures and animations help bring to life principles and content of the subjects they are learning. By so doing, students can take a more active role in their learning.\n\nOne of the advantages of using multimedia resources is they convey information quickly and effectively. In this way, they make students more interested in learning. Moreover, they can learn at their own pace and convenience. All they need is a computer or television and some CD-ROMs.\n\nThe use of multimedia resources in education is widespread today. Its greatest benefit is that it enables a wide range of resources at the learners' disposal. What is happening is for schools to use a combination of class lessons, texts and multimedia resources during lessons."

And others prefer to go for a job that promises elements of glamour and excitement.\nJournalism is actually an interesting and challenging career. It suits those with strong language skills and a passion for writing. Many journalists find great satisfaction in their work.\n\nHere are some guidelines to help those who are thinking of becoming a successful journalist. Firstly, there must be a strong commitment to the job. When joining the company, be it a newspaper or a magazine, trainees during internship must be willing to take time to observe and learn from experienced journalists.\n\nThe period of internship can be a trying one. It is during such time, interns are given the opportunity to demonstrate their talents and skills. To their frustration, they can be required to do trivial tasks such as photocopying, faxing and answering phones. When given writing jobs, they might require researching at home after office hours and writing stories on weekends.\n\nBig or proper writing jobs usually do not become available at the moment they want them. Many successful journalists do freelancing until the right opportunity comes along.\n\nAs journalists, do not just limit yourself to newspaper journalism. You can try out for a job in broadcasting. Most journalists hop between print, magazine and broadcasting many times in their career. Journalists have been known to host their own shows on television while continuously publishing features in the press."

With SMS, this is no longer needed as it is instantaneous. People are now no longer as difficult to reach as before. Users do not have to arrange for meetings or activities much earlier. Now, they just have to send an SMS to their friends. The message will inform their friends of the meeting, time and place of the meeting.\n\nAs it is so prevalent among youths, there are bound to be many repercussions on them. This is particularly so in the use of language. It is the norm to use short forms in typing an SMS text. Spelling out the entire word or sentence would take up more space. More words increase the cost of sending. Hence short-forms and abbreviations are often used.\n\nSending messages like \"See you tonight at 8.30 p.m.\" could be replaced by \"c u tonite, 830\". In this respect, SMS can have a negative effect on language. Students make use of too many short-forms. Some even carry on with the usage of short-forms in their daily school work and essay answers.\n\nMany youths are addicted to sending or receiving SMS texts. A survey disclosed that some send about fifty or even more every day. This incurs high expenses on the phone bill. Despite these disadvantages, SMS is here to stay. This is due to its benefits of cost, convenience and saving time. It has definitely become a culture among the old and young alike."

        "content": "Electronic mail is a means of communication with people. It is also the cheapest and one of the fastest ways of communication. However, just as in other forms of communication, some basic etiquette must be followed.\nFor instance, if you ask for something in your e-mail, you should say `please'. Similarly, if someone does something for you, do reply and say `thank you'. Moreover, include enough information in your mail if you send in a question to which you expect an answer.\n\nAfter sending an e-mail, do not expect an immediate answer. Very often, we have to wait for a while before receiving a reply. Just because you do not get an answer from someone in ten minutes, it does not mean that the person is ignoring you. So there is no cause for offence Never send another e-mail to tell the person off.\n\nWhen composing an e-mail message, make sure you read it over before sending it. Spending time on making your e-mail clearer is time well spent and worth your effort. If the sentences are unclear or ambiguous, you have to take some time to rephrase to make them clearer.\n\nLastly, always use a signature for your mail. The signature identifies who you are. You do not want the receiver to wonder who has sent the mail.\n\nBy observing these rules, your e-mail is likely to be well received. The outcome is that you will receive courteous and satisfactory pleasant e-mail too."

They might be wrong in thinking so.\nSome examples of a career in sports are sports coach, sports teacher, sports writer and athletic director. These jobs involve plenty of hard work, irregular hours and a high energy level.\n\nJust like other careers, sports careers have their pros and cons. The most obvious drawback is the salary. It is usually lower than desired. Another drawback is that the job requires putting in long and irregular hours. Working till late at night, sixty to seventy hours a week is to be expected.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some benefits. Besides enjoying their work, many people in a sports career can get extended time off. For example, those who work as sports masters or teachers in schools have vacation breaks between semesters or during the long holidays.\n\nIf you are interested in checking out a sports career, you have to undergo some type of training first. This is important. This is true in specialized areas such as sports journalism, coaching and sports administration.\n\nTo obtain basic preparation, we have to sign up for an appropriate college program. Many colleges offer courses in sports management, sports medicine, physical education or other related areas. while pursuing the course, it is a good idea to take on a volunteer or part-time role in a sports organization. By getting some firsthand experience, we can be surer if a sports-related career is something we genuinely want to pursue."

After lunch, we were sent to our designated chalets. We had a quick bath and gathered outside for a lesson on how to make the rods for line fishing. A good many of us learnt that the secret to catching something is the quality of bait. The squids we were given proved particularly effective.\n\nFishing is a tough job. There were a ridiculous number of knots to be tied and it was all so complicated. We could smell the salty odor of the waves as the restless tide continuously pounded on our ankles. Slowly but surely, we made our way to the water front and swung our rods out to the sea. The calm weather was very welcoming as we patiently stood, waiting! The first one came after a long wait. We all dropped our rods into the water. While waiting, we also learnt that patience really is a virtue, especially when it comes to fishing.\n\nThe fishing activity and relaxation time among teachers and friends were much appreciated by all, especially after finishing our final exams. The variety of activities provided ensured that we were never bored. Each one of us tried different activities and we made many new friends from different year groups. We were lucky to see some beautiful coral and some amazing marine life.\n\nAs we say goodbye to the island resort, we would also like to say goodbye to some friends at the end of another academic year. Thanks also to the teachers for helping us have such a fun Discovery Week. Without a doubt, going to Pulau Redang was a worthwhile trip. It was full of fun, adventure and self-discovery."

As for performances, we witnessed one the orphans, June, dancing to a hip-hop song and 7-year-old Barry sang a Japanese song.\n\nThe children were really adorable. There was a little boy named Rick, who stuck to June and liked sitting on her lap. There were other volunteers there on that day too. There was one group of people who gave them haircuts. Another group of volunteers gave them tuition lessons.\n\nThe trip ended with a lot of hugs, goodbyes and a huge group picture.

We were assigned to accomplish two activities. They were :\n\n1. Body Mapping\n\nThe students in this group were instructed to trace one of their group member's body onto joined sheets of brown paper. From there, they drew the external body. the other group drew an internal body map. They made it scientific and educational by labeling the sketch. Both groups exhibited good skills. The facilitator, Mr Choo, made jokes while they did the drawings.\n\n2. Role - playing\n\nAfter the body mapping, Mr Choo gave the third and fourth groups a specific topic and instructed them to compose a role-play on that topic. Some of the suggested topics were :\n\n i. AIDS - the definition and prevention of HIV/AIDS\n\nii. Effects of a healthy diet on our body\n\niii. How boys and girls change during puberty\n\niv. Plastic surgery\n\nv. Heart Diseases\n\nFirst, each group was given a topic and guidelines to prepare an activity in twenty minutes.

After each performance, a short explanation was given by Mr Choo. This was to increase our knowledge and understanding.\n\nOn the whole, the time that we spent at the workshop was educational and entertaining. The attendees were kept actively involved.

It is good to use exhaust fans or open the windows when showering and cooking. Remind your mother and maid about this when they are cooking.

This is to prevent mites around. Mites can cause the children an asthma problem or it can aggravate your sister's asthma.\n\nDo you have pets? If you do, you have to keep them outside. Having a cat or puppy indoors can cause your sister to have an asthma attack easily. Using cleaners, paints, adhesives and air fresheners is not advisable. This is because the chemical irritants found in these products can aggravate asthma. The best thing is to use these products less often and also use them when your sister is not around. If you use these products, try to make sure that the windows or doors are open and that you use an exhaust fan.\n\nBy following these instructions, you can prevent your sister's asthma attacks.

I trust it would be to you too, which is why I am here today. The book is titled Science Made Simple written by Sharifah Shazana. It is published by Bunga Publications. The author is a famous scientist-turned-teacher who has been a scientist for 10 years before she started teaching in schools. Ever since then, she has taught in secondary schools for 15 years. Her experience as a scientist has enabled her to know the intricate details of science and how to make it simple for learners, coupled with her years of teaching experience.\nLet's move on to talk about why I find the book useful for myself and for secondary students. First of all, the book caught me right from the start through its beautiful cover design. While we are often told not to judge a book by its cover, one could not help but be drawn to this book as the cover design was very well done.\n\nThat aside, I must say I was very delighted to find that the contents of the book is even better than what the cover design portrayed. The author provides very clear explanations for all the concepts and theories given. Theories which are usually viewed as boring and difficult to understand never seemed simpler. The author has the gift of making complex truths simple to understand for the learner. The clear explanations complemented well with the attractive presentation of diagrams and illustrations which made science not only simple but loads of fun!\n\nAt the end of every chapter, there is a variety of exercises to test the concepts and theories the students have learned. These exercises are handy and great for reinforcement of the knowledge the students have acquired. The exercises are also followed by practice question papers which are written in SPM-format to familiarise students with SPM questions. Sample answers are also given as a guide for the students to write their answers in the best format and style.\n\nNot only that, the book also comes with useful tips that are spread out sporadically throughout the whole book. These tips will help students to identify common errors made in examination and how they can better tackle a question.\n\nThe book was also top on the list of bestsellers in our local bookstores. I believe that this is good enough to consider buying the book!\n\nAll in all, the book really speaks for itself. It is an excellent book you would not want to miss out on. I would highly recommend the book to all of you. You can get the book at our school bookstore at just RM9.80 per copy. I am sure you would enjoy the book as I did.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "The wayang kulit or shadow puppet play is performed primarily as a form of entertainment in small towns and villages. In the past, it was usual for an individual or a group of villagers to erect a hut-like stage on which the dalang (puppeteer) performed the shadow play. The dalang had to obtain a performing license from the local police authorities for the performances on specific dates and in the given location.\nThe wayang kulit is an open air performance under the stars. A temporary bamboo platform is constructed in the village square. It has a raised stage on which the puppeteer and musicians sit cross-legged. This `traveling cinema' was popular in villages during the 1970s. A high cloth fence was temporarily erected in a given locality of the countryside, a large screen put up and some admission was charged. The cinema would play in one place over a period of one or two nights and then move on to another location until its planned circuit was completed.\n\nThe dalang is a highly venerated artist who displays enormous physical and mental endurance. He is an orator who must be able to repeat many lengthy texts word for word. In addition, he has to compose and sing songs as well as direct the orchestra that accompanies him. Besides all this, he is a poet-playwright who shares new wisdom in a way that satisfies public taste.\n\nA feature of the performance structure was the ritual opening of prayers and food offerings presented to the spirit world. Following customary practice, the play usually began with incantations and prayers asking for safety and help in avoiding danger. However, this practice had been banned because it is not in accordance to Islamic teachings. Wayang kulit performances are now held solely for entertainment purposes."

All of us gathered there were terribly shocked as there was a loud explosion soon after three firemen had entered the building. I was surprised when I heard one of the firemen talk to those who had entered. He was telling them in clear and unhurried tones to go on ahead as the explosion they expected was over. Only then did it strike me that the fire brigade knew more about the fire in one look than anybody gathered there.\n\nAlthough the flames were more than thirty feet high, to my utter surprise, it was brought down within just ten minutes. I noticed that they had a systematic way of attacking the fire and breaking windows to open up safe channels for the fire to be directed before being attacked with the hoses.\n\nThe professional finesse and well-trained casual manner of the firemen really opened my eyes and mind to how much of preparation and guidance they have.\n\nCongratulations on a job done exceedingly well.

Being close to the area where parents' cars and the school buses part outside the school, it is a favourite place for students to congregate while waiting for their transport home.\nThe plastic chairs and tables at the stall are not just an eyesore they are also badly in need of washing. Curry spilt while serving and eating are wiped with a dirty smelly rag which badly needs washing. Without a shadow of doubt, it may be assumed that that single piece of cloth can spread unknown germs to the students who eat or drink there. Most of the glasses and plates used are chipped. In their state, it would not be surprising if some student were to inadvertently swallow a piece of broken glass or plate. The danger this is in causing internal injuries can never be taken lightly.\n\nThe cleanliness of the place is appropriately declared by the number of rats, flies and cockroaches that may be seen enjoying life there. When this is noted together with the uncovered food displayed in the glass display shelf, it leaves little to the imagination. The cleanliness issue is further compounded by the fact that the plates, glasses and other utensils are all dip-washed in two large basins and before a final dipping in a smaller basin. Washing without running water raises further health concerns.\n\nThe cook does neither wears an apron or any sort of covering on the head. The servers (it would be blasphemy to call them waiters) in clothes that look badly in needs of washing makes the observant shudder in disgust. The utter disregard for hygiene can be the cause of allergies and diseases. Cases of allergies and diseases from this unhygienic place do not feature in any reports simply because there has been no informal retrieval.\n\nThe place is popular with many school students. It is common to see them have a snack while waiting for their cars or buses. To the observant, this place looks like a disaster waiting to happen. It is sincerely hoped that this report is taken with the same seriousness with which it is written."
